# I am as a programmer and as a person
My name is _Yi-Chan Chiu_, a fourth-year Computer Engineering student. This is my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/fc_chiu1113/). As a programmer, I think there are some skills that I have and some skills I need to learn.

There are lots of article about software engineering, and I find that this [article](https://www.institutedata.com/us/blog/10-must-have-software-engineering-skills/) created by _institutedata_ on  **NOVEMBER 9, 2023** tells the essential skills to become a software engineer.

In the article, there are 10 skills. I pick out some that I have and I do not have:

- [x] Attention to detail and quality assurance
- [x] Continuous learning and adaptability
- [ ] Proficiency in multiple programming languages
- [ ] Mastery of algorithms and data structures

**Skills I have:**
```
- I am a listener.

- I like to learn new stuff.

- Thinking ideas and design the plan.
```

**Skills I need to practice and learn:**
```
1. Programming.

2. Learning new coding languages

3. Thinking more logically.
```

I always remembered that my high school teacher said: 

> Student must be active to learn new stuffs and must have the postive mind to do whatever you like.

After I enrolled UCSD, I truely learned a lot about hardware and software skills, and I realized that software skills have more problems I face than the hardware skills. For example, coding is not my favor. I need to learn for a long period to get it fluent. However, I think my skills above is important in the group when we have a group project to do in the future. As a programmer sometime can be said as a person, person can be a good listener and give someone the direction of thoughts.

I will learn more about how to become a software engineer in this class! Hope I will use these skills to make me suitable in future jobs after graduating!
